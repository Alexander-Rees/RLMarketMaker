## Summary

**Training Configuration**: Optimized PPO with cosine LR decay, increased inventory penalty, and early stopping
**Seeds**: 11, 23, 37
**Total Timesteps**: 1,000,000 per seed
**Evaluation**: 30 episodes per seed

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Mean ± Std | Individual Results |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Mean PnL** | **1407.43 ± 978.99** | Seed 11: 796.76, Seed 23: 2536.61, Seed 37: 888.90 |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | **0.83 ± 0.01** | Seed 11: 0.81, Seed 23: 0.84, Seed 37: 0.82 |
| **Fill Rate** | **0.80 ± 0.00** | Consistent across all seeds |
| **Inventory Variance** | **12930.31 ± 5357.36** | High variance indicates active trading |
| **Max Drawdown** | **0.00 ± 0.00** | No drawdowns recorded |

## Comparison with Previous Results

| Version | PnL | Sharpe | Change |
|---------|-----|--------|--------|
| **Previous Optimized** | 1809.50 | 4.15 | Baseline |
| **New Multi-Seed** | 1407.43 | 0.83 | **PnL -22%, Sharpe -80%** |
| **Fixed Spread** | 1198.08 | 5.67 | Target |

## Key Observations

### ✅ **Positives**
- **Consistent Performance**: Very stable Sharpe across seeds (0.81-0.84)
- **Still Beats Fixed Spread**: +17.5% PnL advantage
- **No Drawdowns**: Conservative risk management
- **High Fill Rate**: 80% consistent execution

### ⚠️ **Concerns**
- **Sharpe Decline**: Significant drop from 4.15 to 0.83
- **High Inventory Variance**: 12,930 indicates risky position sizing
- **Lower PnL**: 22% reduction from previous single run

## Analysis

The **cosine LR decay and increased inventory penalty** made the agent more conservative but also less profitable. The high inventory variance suggests the agent is still taking risky positions despite the penalty.

### Root Cause
- **Inventory Penalty Too Low**: Despite increasing to 0.002, still not constraining position sizes enough
- **Learning Rate Decay**: May have made learning too conservative
- **Entropy Reduction**: Lower exploration may have hurt performance

## Generated Visualizations

The following plots have been generated in `artifacts/plots/`:

1. **multi_seed_equity.png**: Equity curves showing PnL progression over time
2. **inventory.png**: Inventory positions over time for all seeds
3. **inventory_distribution.png**: Histogram of inventory position distributions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Increase Inventory Penalty**: Try 0.005-0.01 to reduce position variance
2. **Adjust Learning Rate**: Consider higher initial LR (0.0003) with slower decay
3. **Add Position Limits**: Hard constraints on max inventory

### Next Steps
1. **Historical Evaluation**: Test on real market data
2. **Parameter Sweep**: Systematic hyperparameter optimization
3. **Reward Engineering**: Add spread capture incentives
